- The "Verses" key should contain the song segmented into verses, with each verse separated by a line break.
- The "Syllables" key should contain an array of integers representing the syllable count for each verse, where underscores count as one (synalepha).

**Do not provide any explanations, reasoning, or extra text. Do not think aloud. Only respond with the JSON object**.
